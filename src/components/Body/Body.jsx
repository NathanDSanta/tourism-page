      <h3>Why Visit Banyoles?</h3>
      <p>Banyoles offers a perfect balance of nature and culture in a compact, welcoming setting.
        The Estany de Banyoles invites you to slow down by the water, enjoy a walk, or try rowing
        in one of Catalonia’s most iconic landscapes. The Museu Darder and the Parc Neolític de la
        Draga bring the region’s past to life, from natural history to prehistoric settlements.
        And the Monestir de Sant Esteve adds a touch of medieval charm right in the heart of town.
        It’s an easy, peaceful destination that rewards curiosity and invites you to disconnect.</p>
